# BlogOverFlow
## Backend of our blog platform based on Django

Backend part of our blog platform using **Django** and several services provided by **AWS**.   
Designed 20+ RESTFUL APIs to cater to requests coming from the frontend. Error handlers are designed and implemented to ensure our user experience.  
Techiniques used in the backend are:  
Python, Django, Networks, Elastic Beanstalk(AWS), MySQL, MongoDB.


## Product Pitch
BlogOverFlow is a cloud based platform for people to write and share about their interesting things in life. Registered users on our platform are able to create blogs, add hashtags, and read other peopleâ€™s blogs. Blogger aims to create a friendly community and ads-free environment for users to keep their memory, share their ideas and discover interesting things.
